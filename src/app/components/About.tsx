      <p>
        I am Krystian Za≈Çuski. Since 2020, I have been learning front-end
        development. I started by creating games in pure JavaScript. Currently,
        I am working on business websites using the React and Next.js
        frameworks. I am currently studying computer science. I am seeking a
        position as a junior front-end developer and am eager to expand my
        skills in this field.
